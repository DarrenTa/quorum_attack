I used the 60% threshold (240) in this, but those numbers can be changed before execution.

This script just calculates a probability.  I got if the attacker has 500 Mn out of 5000 total nodes, then the chance that one masternode quorum has 240 attacking nodes is:

7.10737466412e-157

which is quite small.
